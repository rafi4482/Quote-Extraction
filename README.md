# Automated Web Data Extraction

This project provides a comprehensive guide and implementation for automated web data extraction using Python. It focuses on efficiently scraping data from web pages, handling pagination, error management, data storage, and basic visualization.

## Features

- **Web Scraping:** Extract data from web pages using the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries.
- **Pagination Handling:** Scrape multiple pages of data using a loop to navigate through them.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to manage request failures and other potential issues.
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevent overloading the target website by adding delays between requests.
- **Data Cleaning:** Clean and preprocess the scraped data for analysis.
- **Data Storage:** Store the extracted data in CSV format for easy access and further analysis.
- **Visualization:** Generate basic visualizations to analyze the scraped data.
- **Logging:** Track the progress of the scraping process and log any errors or issues encountered.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
├── Web-Scraping.ipynb      # Jupyter notebook containing the code and explanations
├── scraped_quotes.csv      # Example output file (CSV format)
├── README.md               # Project documentation
└── requirements.txt        # List of required Python packages
```

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following packages installed:

- Python 3.x
- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automated-web-data-extraction.git
   cd automated-web-data-extraction
   ```

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

   Open the `Web-Scraping.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to execute the web scraping process. The notebook contains detailed explanations and code snippets for each step.

3. **View the Results:**

   After running the notebook, the scraped data will be saved in the `scraped_quotes.csv` file. You can analyze the data directly in the CSV file or visualize it using the provided code.

## Example Visualization

The project includes basic data visualization, such as plotting the number of quotes by author:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("scraped_quotes.csv")
df['author'].value_counts().plot(kind='bar')
plt.title("Number of Quotes by Author")
plt.xlabel("Author")
plt.ylabel("Number of Quotes")
plt.show()
```
